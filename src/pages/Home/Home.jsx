                <h1>History of APG</h1>
                The Armenian Professional Group (APG) was founded in 2020 by Sarven Ornekian, Marco Ruizian, and Charles
                Grodian. The organization was established with the aim of promoting fellowship and encouraging young
                Armenians to pursue higher education.
                <br />
                <br />
                The founders of APG were motivated by their own experiences as Armenian-Americans. They recognized that many
                young Armenians struggle to find their place in American society and that there is a lack of support for
                those who wish to pursue higher education. As a result, they decided to create an organization that would
                provide a supportive community for Armenian professionals and students.
                <br />
                <br />
                The initial group was small, but it quickly grew as more Armenians became interested in the organization's mission.
                APG held its first official meeting in January of 2020, which was attended by over 50 people. During this meeting,
                the founders discussed their vision for the organization and brainstormed ideas for how to achieve their goals.
                <br />
                <br />
                Over the following months, APG began to establish itself as a prominent organization within the Armenian-American
                community. The group held regular meetings and events, which were attended by both professionals and students.
                APG also established partnerships with local schools and universities, providing mentorship and networking
                opportunities for young Armenians.
                <br />
                <br />
                One of APG's most notable achievements was the establishment of a scholarship program for Armenian-American students.
                This program provided financial assistance to students who demonstrated academic excellence and a commitment to their
                Armenian heritage. The scholarship program quickly became one of APG's flagship initiatives and helped to solidify
                the organization's reputation as a champion of higher education.
                <br />
                <br />
                Today, APG continues to grow and expand its reach. The organization has established chapters in several major cities
                across the United States and has partnerships with numerous schools and universities. APG's founders are proud of what
                they have achieved and remain committed to promoting fellowship and encouraging young Armenians to pursue their dreams.
